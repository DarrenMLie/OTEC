# OTEC

Warsinger Lab OTEC Project

The Warsinger Water Lab is recruiting an undergraduate researcher to help create the first global estimate of the thermodynamic exergy potential from Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). OTEC consists of harnessing the energy stored in the temperature gradient, or thermocline, that exists between the ocean surface and deep ocean water. While OTEC has been theorized since the 1880s because oceans are complex systems with spatiotemporally changing multiphysics, no globally generalized models have been created to assess total global exergy potential. The recruited undergraduate researcher will take part in developing a machine learning model to predict the ocean thermocline based on both location and time and use this generalized model alongside robust thermodynamic models to create global exergy maps for OTEC. The undergraduate researcher will not only gain valuable experience with modelling but also, alternative clean energy, machine learning, neural network tuning, super-computing cluster resources, publishable figure creation, and research paper composition.

Requirements:
• Strong Python coding skills
• Robust problem-solving skills
• Ability to learn new skills quickly
• Strong communication skills (verbally, written, and through figures)
• Familiarity with GitHub or other code organization tools
• Basic thermodynamic knowledge
